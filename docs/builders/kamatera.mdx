## Tutorial

Set environment variables with your Kamatera API key (you can generate an API key from the [Kamatera console]() -> API -> Keys):

```
export KAMATERA_API_CLIENT_ID=
export KAMATERA_API_SECRET=
```

Create a new directory named `packer_tutorial` and paste the following configuration into a file named `kamatera-ubuntu.pkr.hcl`:

```
packer {
  required_plugins {
    kamatera = {
      version = ">= 0.3.3"
      source  = "github.com/kamatera/kamatera"
    }
  }
}

source "kamatera" "ubuntu" {
  datacenter = "EU"
  ssh_username = "root"
  image_name = "ubuntu-example-packer-image"
}

build {
  sources = [
    "source.kamatera.ubuntu"
  ]
  provisioner "shell" {
    environment_vars = [
      "FOO=hello world",
    ]
    inline = [
      "echo Creating example.txt",
      "echo \"FOO is $FOO\" > example.txt",
    ]
  }
}
```

Change to the `packer_tutorial` directory and run the following commands to download the Kamatera plugin:

```
packer init .
```

Build the image:

```
packer build .
```

Please wait, this will take a while...

When done, log-in to [Kamatera console](https://console.kamatera.com) and navigate to My Cloud -> Hard Disk Library.
Choose zone `EU` and click on MY PRIVATE IMAGES - you should see the created image there.

You can now create a new server from this image, SSH into that server and run `cat example.txt`.
The output should be `FOO is hello world` - as it was generated in the provisioning script in your pkr.hcl file.
